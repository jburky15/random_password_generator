# Random Password Generator
A random password generator built using Python 3.10

Just a small, terminal based, program that will output a randomly generated (16 character) password for you to use.

Includes lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols.

Please note: You may have to modify the resulting password as not all services allow some of the symbols used.
